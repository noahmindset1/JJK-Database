However, she does tend to show concern for others, such as when she made a cover-up about Yasohachi Bridge so that the female civilian who had its curse wouldn't panic.[1] She also didn't want Maki Zenin and Nobara Kugisaki to head off to break the veil right away, despite being accompanied by a Special Grade 1 Naobito.[2] Even though Haruta was after her, she asked Kugisaki to not push herself. Once she was rescued from the former by Nanami Even though she was badly injured, she made sure to ask him if Ijichi was still alive.[3]"

Additionally, the Angel's epithet for Sukuna, \"Disgraced One\" (堕天, Daten?, lit. \"Fallen One\"), is most likely derived from the Japanese word for \"Fallen Angel\" (堕天使, Datenshi?).\nThe \"Jacob's Ladder\" technique is named after the ladder seen by the biblical patriarch Jacob in the Book of Genesis.
