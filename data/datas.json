Once she was rescued from the former by Nanami Even though she was badly injured, she made sure to ask him if Ijichi was still alive.[3]",

Additionally, the Angel's epithet for Sukuna, \"Disgraced One\" (堕天, Daten?, lit. \"Fallen One\"), is most likely derived from the Japanese word for \"Fallen Angel\" (堕天使, Datenshi?).\nThe \"Jacob's Ladder\" technique is named after the ladder seen by the biblical patriarch Jacob in the Book of Genesis. The technique's use comes with a prayer-like chant, involves the creation of all-purifying light meant to \"erase sin\", and spawns a trumpet of light for Hana to sound (possibly based on the seven trumpets of Revelation), as well as cross-like shapes and small cherubic beings that fly around the target.\nA particular scene where Hana saves a US soldier from a curse[42] is an obvious allusion to the famous fresco painting The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo.",

This lead him to even underestimate jujutsu sorcerers, who he initially thought of as just psychics without any real training.
